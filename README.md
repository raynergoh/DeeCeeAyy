# üìà DCA Valuation-Aware Trading Bot

A Python trading bot that dynamically adjusts dollar-cost-averaging (DCA) investments in the S&P 500 (SPY) based on market valuation, using the difference between the S&P 500 index price and its PE ratio as a relative value indicator.

---

## Features

- **Valuation-Aware DCA**: Allocates more capital when the market is "cheap" (by PE ratio), and less when "expensive".
- **Minimum Investment Threshold**: Never invests less than a configurable percentage (e.g., 80%) of the DCA amount, ensuring consistent market exposure even in expensive conditions.
- **Automated Data Fetching**: Dynamically retrieves up-to-date S&P 500 PE ratios and prices.
- **Backtesting Support**: Evaluate strategy performance on historical data.
- **Live Trading Capability**: Integrates with Alpaca for real or paper trading.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Easily adjust DCA amount and valuation sensitivity, and minimum investment threshold.
- **Secure Credentials**: API keys are managed via environment variables or a `.env` file.
- **Robust Logging**: All trades and errors are logged for transparency.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Fetches PE Data**  
   Gets current and year-ago S&P 500 PE ratios using dynamic data sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance via `yfinance`or Multpl.com).

2. **Calculates Relative Expensiveness**  
   Compares the year-over-year (YoY) change in index price to the YoY change in PE ratio.

3. **Adjusts Investment Amount**  
   - If the market is relatively cheap (price growth < PE growth), increases DCA.
   - If expensive, decreases DCA, but never below the minimum investment threshold (e.g., 80% of the base DCA amount).

4. **Executes Trades Automatically**  
   Places buy orders for SPY via the Alpaca API at monthly intervals, on the first trading day of each month.

## ‚öñÔ∏è How the Bot Uses Market Valuation to Adjust DCA

The chart above shows the **difference between the S&P 500 index price and its P/E ratio** (blue bars), alongside the actual S&P 500 index level (red line). This difference serves as a **relative valuation signal**.

### üí° How It Works

The trading bot dynamically adjusts the dollar-cost-averaging (DCA) investment amount based on how expensive or cheap the market appears, using the following principle:

- üìâ **If price growth is less than PE growth**: The market is relatively undervalued ‚Üí **invest more**
- üìà **If price growth exceeds PE growth**: The market is relatively overvalued ‚Üí **invest less**

This prevents over-investing during market exuberance and encourages heavier investment during corrections or undervaluations.

## üî¢ What is the Multiplier?

The `multiplier` in the config is a **sensitivity factor** that controls how aggressively the investment amount is adjusted based on valuation.

### For example:

If your base DCA amount is `$500` and the valuation delta is `+0.02`, and your minimum investment threshold is 70%, then:

```python
min_investment = 0.7 * DCA_amount
adjusted_amount = max(DCA_amount - (multiplier * valuation_delta), min_investment)
```

So, if the calculated amount falls below $350, the bot will still invest at least $350.
- A higher multiplier makes the bot more responsive to valuation changes
- A lower multiplier makes it more conservative
- The minimum investment threshold prevents chronic underinvestment

**‚ö†Ô∏è Choose a multiplier that matches your risk tolerance and market outlook**

## üîß Set Up Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd DeeCeeAyy
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you use a `.env` file for secrets (recommended), also install:

```sh
pip install python-dotenv
```

### 3. Configure API Keys

Recommended: Use a `.env` file in your project directory:

```sh
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_api_key
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_alpaca_secret_key
```

Or, set environment variables in your shell:

```sh
export ALPACA_API_KEY="your_alpaca_api_key"
export ALPACA_SECRET_KEY="your_alpaca_secret_key"
```

**üîí Important: Never share or commit your API keys or .env file to version control.**

## ‚öôÔ∏è CONFIGURATION

You can modify strategy parameters directly in `tbot.py`:

- multiplier: Controls how much to scale the DCA amount based on valuation delta **(default: 300)**
- DCA_amount: Base dollar amount to invest at each interval **(default: 500)**
- min_investment_pct: The minimum fraction of the DCA amount to invest each month (e.g., 0.7 for 70%). **(default: 0.7)**

These can be adjusted directly in the script or passed when initializing the strategy.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è RUNNING THE BOT

### üîÅ Backtesting Mode (Recommended for first-time users)

This will simulate trades using historical data.
```sh
python tbot.py
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
- By default, live = False in `tbot.py`, so it will run in backtest mode.
- Backtest period: 1998-01-01 to 2015-12-31 (modifiable in tbot.py)
=======
- By default, live = False in `tbot.py`, so it will run in backtest m  ode.
- Backtest period: 2005-01-01 to 2015-12-31 (modifiable in tbot.py)
>>>>>>> 3363351824d88922d94bca834ef91eebcb28c2bf
- Results: Review logs and output for performance metrics.

### üíπ Live Trading Mode
To enable live trading, edit `tbot.py` and set:
```sh
if __name__ == "__main__":
    live = True
```
Then run:
```sh
python tbot.py
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Live trading will place real trades using your Alpaca account.
Always start with paper trading before using real funds.**

## üîê Security
API keys should be stored in a `.env` file or set as environment variables.

Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

Example `.gitignore` entry:

```sh
.env
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

| **Issue**                     | **Solution**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing API Keys             | Ensure your `.env` file or environment variables are set correctly.          |
| Dependency Issues            | Make sure all required packages are installed. Use **Python 3.10** for compatibility with Lumibot. |
| Data Fetch Errors            | Verify your internet connection and ensure the data sources (e.g. Yahoo Finance) are available. |
| yfinance/Benchmark Data Gaps |	If you see missing trades or skipped months, this may be due to Yahoo Finance data gaps. Consider using a more reliable data source for research-grade backtesting.|
